# abus-seccor-fix
Bat file to fix Abus Seccor Key Manager (4.1.1.9, Build 296) starting on Windows 11

This script is not dynamic and requires you to have the following paths:

- Java JDK should be at path: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-8.0.432.6-hotspot"
- Application should be installed at standard path: "C:\Program Files (x86)\ABUS\SKM"

Change the bat file, of you have different paths.
