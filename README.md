Bat file to fix Abus Seccor Key Manager (4.1.1.9, Build 296) starting on Windows 11

This script is not dynamic and requires you to have the following paths:

- Java from the orig. install file should be at standard path: "C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_301"
- Application should be installed at standard path: "C:\Program Files (x86)\ABUS\SKM"

Change the bat file, of you have different paths.
